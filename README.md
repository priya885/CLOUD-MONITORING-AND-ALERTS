# TASK DESCRIPTION: CLOUD-MONITORING-AND-ALERTS

In this task, I worked on setting up cloud monitoring and alerts using Google Cloud Monitoring. The goal was to keep track of a cloud system's performance and get alerts if anything goes wrong. This task helped me understand how to check the health of cloud-based services and respond to any issue early.

*STEP 1*: Create Monitoring Workspace
I started by logging into the Google Cloud Console. From the left side menu, I selected Monitoring. It asked me to create a workspace, which is like a special area where all monitoring data is collected and shown. I gave it a name and connected it to my current project. Once the workspace was ready, I moved to the dashboard section.

*STEP 2*: Build Dashboard for Metrics
The dashboard is a place where I can add charts and graphs that show important system metrics. I clicked on "Create Dashboard" and gave it a name. Then, I added some widgets.

The first chart showed the CPU usage of a virtual machine in real-time. I also added another chart for disk usage. These charts help me quickly understand if the system is working fine or getting overloaded. I adjusted the time range to "Last 1 hour" to watch recent activity. It was simple and easy to set up.

*STEP 3*: Set Up Alert Policy
After the dashboard was ready, I moved to the Alerting section. I clicked "Create Policy" to make a new alert rule. I selected CPU usage as the metric to monitor. Then, I set the condition: if CPU usage goes above 80% for more than 5 minutes, it should trigger an alert.

This step is important because alerts help cloud admins know when there’s a problem without checking the dashboard all the time.

*STEP 4*: Add Notification Channel
To receive alerts, I needed to add a notification channel. I chose email for this. I entered my Gmail ID, and Google sent a confirmation link. After confirming it, the alert was ready to send me messages if the condition was met.

This way, if anything goes wrong, I’ll get an email alert immediately and can take action.

*STEP 5*: Review Dashboard
At the end, I opened the Monitoring Dashboard again and checked the charts. They showed updated data in real-time. It gave me a clear view of the system performance. The graphs were simple, and I could understand how the system was behaving just by looking at them.

*Final Deliverables*

I took the screenshot of:

# CONCLUSION
This task gave me a good experience with cloud monitoring tools. I learned how to build a custom dashboard and how to set alerts that actually work. These skills are important in real-world jobs to make sure cloud services keep running smoothly.
